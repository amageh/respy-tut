    "## Problem Set - Dynamic life-cycle models of human capital accumulation with respy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem set, we will work with Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin (EKW) models, a class of dynamic discrete choice models that are used to address economic questions in the realm of labor and education economics. Prominent examples of such models in economic research are Keane and Wolpin (1994, 1997, 2000) and more recently Blundell et al. (2016), Adda et al. (2017), and Eckstein et al. (2019). For the problem set, we will be working with a toy model that follows the famous story of Robinson Crusoe who is stranded on a deserted island. Our version of this story focuses on his work and leisure decisions during the time on the island, specifically the human capital he accumulates as he engages in productive activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the Python package [respy](https://respy.readthedocs.io) to implement and analyze the economic model. Below, you find a summary of the economic framework of the problem set. For a detailed description of this specific model, please refer to the [introductory tutorial](https://respy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/robinson_crusoe.html) in the **respy** documentation. An extended outline of EKW models using the example of the seminal model presented in Keane and Wolpin (1997) can be found in the [explanations](https://respy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanations/index.html) section of the documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem set consists of four exercises. In the first exercise you are asked to examine the simulated data in detail and identify components that make up the rewards in the model. The second exercise explores the modeling and policy evaluation capabilities of **respy** in the context of the intertemporal trade-off that Robinson is facing. The third exercise focuses on the discrete choice dynamic programming problem that lies at the heart of the structural model to explore the trade-off between computation time and model components. Lastly, the fourth exercise explores the numerical integration of the expected value functions to illustrate numerical components of model implementation."

With increasing model components like choices, individual characteristics, and time periods the computational complexity of this problem increases as the potential states (state space) that have to be considered to determine Robinson's optimal choice path grows. In this exercise we will thus inspect the state space and computation time of the model in more detail. A **respy**'s model can be solved in two steps:\n",

In the following we assess how different modeling components affect the solution time of the model.\n",

Repeat the exercise 10 times for each number of periods and plot the mean solve time to compare how to solution time increases with the number of periods considered in the model. **Note that you only need to time the second step ```state_space = solve(params)``` shown above**.\n",
